        late spring of 269, a large party of Sutlanders (who call themselves Busina)
        landed on Iliapin with approximately forty ships and estimated over a thousand
        raiders. They sacked several villages and the town of Whitbrook over the course
        of three weeks. In the town of Staghill, they killed some five thousand people,
        men, women and children, and there were no survivors reported.</i></p><p><i>A
        coalition of forces was being assembled to deal with this threat. It was not
        some ruler that organized this coalition, but by a foreign woman who began
        by railing commoners to stand and defend themselves&hellip;.</i></p><p><i>…
        The Sutlanders left Iliapin before the troops could assemble, and for reasons
        unknown…</i></p><p><i>&ndash;Aakna, Sage of Elhrub</i></p><p><i>Year 372</i></p><p>Ingunn
        walked with a measured pace along the game trail through a forest of alien
        trees. Many of these trees supported leaves rather than needles, unlike the
        trees of her homeland. Some trees even bore the remains of flowers.</p><p>She
        had passed the last Busina sentry an hour ago. He had not tried to stop her
        or accompany her, for do so would be a sure way to incur the wrath of the
        Pythoness.</p><p>So far, her people’s raids had been fruitful. They had already
        sacked a small city and a few towns with little resistance. One town had tried
        to offer tribute to the Busina so not to attack, and it was Ingunn who ordered
        the town razed because they had tried to bribe them. Had a single warrior
        tried to stand against the Busina, they may have lived. The Busina put everyone
        to death because of their cowardice.</p><p>The Busina had accumulated slaves,
        iron, livestock, and food through their raids. They had harvested many large
        trees along the coast. They could breed more warriors, forge more weapons
        and build more ships, with these spoils. When they returned home, the warriors
        would receive a heroes’ welcome, and the Pythonesses were to be seen as demigods,
        with Ingunn chief among them.</p><p>Ingunn already held much sway over her
        clan and the other Pythonesses. Few would dare challenge her, especially if
        they wished to enter the next world, but there were those who would try. She
        needed more power to deal with them, as she had one of her apprentices.</p><p>Asta
        had tried to challenge her once, by seducing Svalfi. He was a capable leader
        and shrewd trader amongst the Busina, and would have made a fine chieftain
        and clan leader under Ingunn. Svalfi decided to side with Asta to form their
        own clan. It was Svalfi’s own wife who informed Ingunn of their plan. In retribution,
        Ingunn left them and twenty others stranded on an island. Ingunn also cut
        out Asta’s tongue before she blinded her so she could not use her sight, or
        tell others what she might read in the runes and bones. </p><p>That was five
        years ago. When Ingunn and the Busina passed the island this time, no one
        saw any sign of smoke, fire, or other signs of the exiles.</p><p>It had been
        several years since Ingunn and two of her chieftains, Athils and Gest, had
        made a raid to this land. They had been quite successful in previous years
        that they did not have to risk such a venture. Eventually, Athils sought to
        make himself a king and Gest sought to help him with that, as it would be
        Gest’s son, Athils’s son-in-law, who would inherit that crown. But early in
        the planning, Ingunn had a strange feeling about this raid.</p><p>Now, the
        Pythonesses debated on what to do, as some wanted to move inland for more
        targets, while others wanted to scour the coast. Ingunn wanted to explore
        inland and see if they could find a place for a colony. They had sufficient
        troops to start a settlement while the ships returned to bring back the families
        that had stayed behind. Yet, something gave Ingunn pause about proposing this.</p><p>She
        stopped for a moment and reached into the pouch tied to her belt and pulled
        three rune stones from it. Looking at the runes, she saw light, conflict and
        path. She screwed her face at the runes as she looked at them, trying to find
        their meaning. Ingunn put the runes back in the pouch and resumed walking.</p><p>Soon,
        the scent of smoke caught Ingunn’s nose. She pulled her knife and followed
        the smell, and tracked it to a young girl who might have been fourteen. The
        girl was calmly sitting by a small fire that had a small gourd over it. Her
        dress was brown and red and not much different from the ones worn by some
        of the newly gained slaves. To Ingunn, the girl’s relaxed demeanor showed
        she was waiting for someone.</p><p>Again, Ingunn pulled runes from her pouch.
        Light, conflict, path. Was it this girl? Was she a pythoness also? She replaced
        the runes and tried to envision what she should do, but there was a mist blocking
        her sight.</p><p>Ingunn had barely stepped towards the girl to either capture
        her, or, failing that, kill her, when the girl stood up. “I have been expecting
        you,” the girl said, facing Ingunn. “I am to parley with you.” She spoke in
        the language used by Businan slaves.</p><p>Ingunn smiled to herself. Someone
        has sent this poor girl to meet her fate. Soon she would either be a slave,
        a toy, or dead.</p><p>“Please come closer. I have tea, if you drink such things,”
        the girl said, with some nervousness in her voice.</p><p>Ingunn approached
        at this, wary of any traps or ambushes.</p><p>“No need for all that caution.
        Had I wished harm to you, I have friends who could have already done that.
        And please, there is no need for your knife.”</p><p>Ingunn paused for a second,
        sensing the girl. Yes, it was the girl. She was a pythoness and seemingly
        powerful one in her own right. She would be a wonderful prize for Gest’s son.
        But she was wary, so Ingunn would have to bide her time some.</p><p>“How did
        you know I was coming? Who sent you?” Ingunn asked with authority.</p><p>The
        girl seemed a little unnerved by Ingunn’s questions. “I am,” the girl started
        before she took a deep breath, sat back down, and continued. “I am Hani. My
        mother, Sarior, sent me to meet with you. And like you, we possess the gift
        of sight.”</p><p>Ingunn’s eyes narrowed as she examined Hani. She could sense
        the girl was uneasy, but she did not seem scared. She possessed a determination
        to do what her mother had sent her to do. Ingunn walked towards the fire where
        Hani sat.</p><p>“You and your mother might possess the sight, but you are
        weak and do not know how to use it. You lanweallers will succumb to us Busina,
        and I will take you and your mother and either make you trophies, or destroy
        you.”</p><p>Hani did not flinch at this threat, as she poured a colored liquid
        into a pair of cups. With Hani’s eyes diverted, Ingunn saw this as an opportunity
        to take her quarry and lunged at Hani.</p><p>Before Ingunn’s attack could
        land, Hani rolled and spun away. Ingunn immediately recovered, wide eyed to
        find Hani was now standing several feet away, holding her own knife, braced
        for another attack.</p><p>Hani looked down at the ground where she had been
        sitting and said, with a note of disappointment, “You’ve made me spill our
        tea.” She then locked her gaze on Ingunn. “You cannot win, for I can see your
        moves before you act and the aelves have taught me to fight,” Hani said with
        a confidence Ingunn had not expected. “Should you attempt to harm me again,
        Fate will destroy your expedition, thus ruin you. “</p><p>When Ingunn hesitated
        about what to do next, Hani said, “Twice while coming here, you pulled runes.
        Twice you pulled the same runes. Light, conflict and path. You have not yet
        fully deciphered their meaning. But I know their meaning,” Hani said, with
        emphasis on her last statement.</p><p>“The ‘light’ is knowledge and information.
        This I have for you. The ‘conflict’ is what to do with the information I am
        to give you and the choices you make with it. The ‘path’ is the course of
        action you take with it.”</p><p>“So be it, girl. Give me your words,” Ingunn
        said with a sneer as she lowered her knife. She had underestimated Hani once.
        Now she would listen to her chatter to lull her into a false security before
        she would try again.</p><p>“My mother knows that you are currently debating
        what to do. Some of you wish to push inland, others want to go elsewhere along
        the coast before returning to your home. You alone contemplate moving inland
        to establish a settlement or colony.”</p><p>“But know this, my mother and
        my sisters are building a coalition against you Sutlanders. Several nations
        have already pledged to help and are sending men to fight you. Aelves are
        already in position to harass you and in seven days, there will be enough
        troops to attack you. There are sentries up and down the coast to watch for
        you should you try to move, and their sight grows with each day. You might
        win a few more battles, but your time here is over.”</p><p>Ingunn’s eyes narrowed
        and hissed as she said, “We are masters of the water. We have over a thousand
        fighters, more than enough to crush any force your mother might arrange. You
        lanweallers are too divided to amass more than a few hundred against us. We
        will do as we please.”</p><p>Shaking her head, Hani responded, “You do not
        know my mother. To some here, she has become known as the Seeress, a great
        prophetess. She need not sway kings and emperors directly, but the people
        instead. Once the people stand, their rulers will then stand. And stand in
        the thousands they will.</p><p>“If you try to move inland using the rivers,
        it will be as if the water has turned against you.”</p><p>“But you have another
        option, one you have not yet seen. Leave now with your gains. Return to your
        homeland in success. Some of your rivals, such as Jangerd, will see your success
        and try to repeat it. We will crush them as your coming here has angered many
        of us. And your power will grow.”</p><p>The thought of eliminating her rivals
        put a smile on Ingunn’s face. Especially since she would not have to confront
        them directly. “If what you say about your fighters is true, why tell me this?
        What do you hope to gain?”</p><p>Hani sighed heavily. “Life. Should a fight
        come now, many will die on both sides. This is what we, my mother and I, wish
        to avoid. Even though we have said we would crush your rivals when they attempt
        to repeat what you have done, it would be far fewer deaths for both sides.
        Fewer than if we fought you now.”</p><p>“Make no mistake, though. This is
        not weakness. There are those who see you as a plague and scourge and would
        willingly fight to the last to eliminate you. Some even have the means to
        do so if they realize it. Just as my mother is gathering forces to remove
        you, she holds them at bay. You should not trifle with her. You and I can
        see the hand of Fate before it moves, but my mother can control it if she
        chooses.” This last statement, Hani delivered with great confidence, as if
        she had seen it before.</p><p>The fingers on Ingunn’s free hand rubbed back
        and forth, as if feeling something. Given enough troops and time, the lanweallers
        could defeat her people. Now she was being given a chance to return home with
        success in hand, and an opportunity to eliminate possible future rivals now.</p><p>“And
        what about our slaves? Some of you lanweallers dislike your kind being made
        slaves.”</p><p>Hani hung her head as she spoke, “It pains me and mother to
        say this, but keep them. It will sate some of your kind’s thirst for pillaging
        this land.”</p><p>“I will think about terms and consult the runes, in private.
        I do not know if the other Pythonesses will follow me if I choose to leave,”
        Ingunn said, slightly nodding her head.</p><p>“If necessary, then let them
        choose their own fates,” was Hani’s calm reply. “I have now delivered the
        message and will leave you to contemplate it.” Hani then started walking down
        the game trail opposite the one Ingunn had come in on.</p><p>“You will know
        our decision by our actions,” Ingun said as Hani left.</p><p>***</p><p>It
        had been about an hour after Hani left Ingunn by the sputtering fire before
        she paused for a second to ensure she was not being followed. Not sensing
        anyone, she turned off the game trail and towards a more used path, and just
        before she reached this larger path, she stopped again. This time to throw
        up.</p><p>Hani took a few moments to recover from being sick, and she was
        still shaking from the encounter with Sutlander. The task her mother gave
        her took all her will to keep focused and master her emotions.</p><p>She followed
        the main trail until it exited the forest where there was a small camp of
        soldiers and aelves. A scout force in case the Sutlanders tried to make an
        unexpected move.</p><p>An aelf called out to her, “Hani, are you all right?”</p><p>“Aye,
        I am well. I just need to rest,” she explained.</p><p>“Then go and rest. But
        first, a rider brought a message from your mother for you. It is on your cot.”</p><p>Hani
        made her way to her tent and found the letter and read it:</p><p><i>My daughter,
        I know you were terrified and nervous at the task I sent you on. Often, much
        hangs in the balance and we must know when and the cost of putting our finger
        on the scale. But you have done well, and I am proud of you. At the very least,
        you have bought time for us to organize, and may have ended the threat of
        the Sutlanders yourself.</i></p><p><i>I know it pains you about leaving prisoners
        in the hands of the Sutlanders to become slaves. It pains me too. It is of
        little comfort, but it is better to sacrifice a few hundred to slavery than
        to commit thousands to death.</i></p><p><i>I cannot yet determine what course
        these Sutlander witches, as a whole, will take at this time. However, I have
        seen that several of them will leave Iliapin.</i></p><p><i>I want you to have
        one of the aelves take you to Willow’s Grove in the morning. I have made arrangements
        for the aelves there to guide you and your sisters to Aran. Wait for me there
        and I will join you as soon as I can.</i></p><p><i>Your mother,</i><i>Sarior</i></p><p>Hani’s
        eyes watered up as she fought back the tears, as she reread the letter to
        determine if she would see her mother again. Her ordeal with the Sutlander
        made her question if she could succeed her mother and she was weary after
        the meeting. Unable to focus her sight, she fell into a fitful sleep.</p>\",\"reblog\":{\"comment\":\"<p><h1>The

        three rune stones from it. Looking at the runes, she saw light, conflict and
        path. She screwed her face at the runes as she looked at them, trying to find
        their meaning. Ingunn put the runes back in the pouch and resumed walking.</p><p>Soon,
        the scent of smoke caught Ingunn’s nose. She pulled her knife and followed
        the smell, and tracked it to a young girl who might have been fourteen. The
        girl was calmly sitting by a small fire that had a small gourd over it. Her
        dress was brown and red and not much different from the ones worn by some
        of the newly gained slaves. To Ingunn, the girl’s relaxed demeanor showed
        she was waiting for someone.</p><p>Again, Ingunn pulled runes from her pouch.
        Light, conflict, path. Was it this girl? Was she a pythoness also? She replaced
        the runes and tried to envision what she should do, but there was a mist blocking
        her sight.</p><p>Ingunn had barely stepped towards the girl to either capture
        her, or, failing that, kill her, when the girl stood up. “I have been expecting
        you,” the girl said, facing Ingunn. “I am to parley with you.” She spoke in
        the language used by Businan slaves.</p><p>Ingunn smiled to herself. Someone
        has sent this poor girl to meet her fate. Soon she would either be a slave,
        a toy, or dead.</p><p>“Please come closer. I have tea, if you drink such things,”
        the girl said, with some nervousness in her voice.</p><p>Ingunn approached
        at this, wary of any traps or ambushes.</p><p>“No need for all that caution.
        Had I wished harm to you, I have friends who could have already done that.
        And please, there is no need for your knife.”</p><p>Ingunn paused for a second,
        sensing the girl. Yes, it was the girl. She was a pythoness and seemingly
        powerful one in her own right. She would be a wonderful prize for Gest’s son.
        But she was wary, so Ingunn would have to bide her time some.</p><p>“How did
        you know I was coming? Who sent you?” Ingunn asked with authority.</p><p>The
        girl seemed a little unnerved by Ingunn’s questions. “I am,” the girl started
        before she took a deep breath, sat back down, and continued. “I am Hani. My
        mother, Sarior, sent me to meet with you. And like you, we possess the gift
        of sight.”</p><p>Ingunn’s eyes narrowed as she examined Hani. She could sense
        the girl was uneasy, but she did not seem scared. She possessed a determination
        to do what her mother had sent her to do. Ingunn walked towards the fire where
        Hani sat.</p><p>“You and your mother might possess the sight, but you are
        weak and do not know how to use it. You lanweallers will succumb to us Busina,
        and I will take you and your mother and either make you trophies, or destroy
        you.”</p><p>Hani did not flinch at this threat, as she poured a colored liquid
        into a pair of cups. With Hani’s eyes diverted, Ingunn saw this as an opportunity
        to take her quarry and lunged at Hani.</p><p>Before Ingunn’s attack could
        land, Hani rolled and spun away. Ingunn immediately recovered, wide eyed to
        find Hani was now standing several feet away, holding her own knife, braced
        for another attack.</p><p>Hani looked down at the ground where she had been
        sitting and said, with a note of disappointment, “You’ve made me spill our
        tea.” She then locked her gaze on Ingunn. “You cannot win, for I can see your
        moves before you act and the aelves have taught me to fight,” Hani said with
        a confidence Ingunn had not expected. “Should you attempt to harm me again,
        Fate will destroy your expedition, thus ruin you. “</p><p>When Ingunn hesitated
        about what to do next, Hani said, “Twice while coming here, you pulled runes.
        Twice you pulled the same runes. Light, conflict and path. You have not yet
        fully deciphered their meaning. But I know their meaning,” Hani said, with
        emphasis on her last statement.</p><p>“The ‘light’ is knowledge and information.
        This I have for you. The ‘conflict’ is what to do with the information I am
        to give you and the choices you make with it. The ‘path’ is the course of
        action you take with it.”</p><p>“So be it, girl. Give me your words,” Ingunn
        said with a sneer as she lowered her knife. She had underestimated Hani once.
        Now she would listen to her chatter to lull her into a false security before
        she would try again.</p><p>“My mother knows that you are currently debating
        what to do. Some of you wish to push inland, others want to go elsewhere along
        the coast before returning to your home. You alone contemplate moving inland
        to establish a settlement or colony.”</p><p>“But know this, my mother and
        my sisters are building a coalition against you Sutlanders. Several nations
        have already pledged to help and are sending men to fight you. Aelves are
        already in position to harass you and in seven days, there will be enough
        troops to attack you. There are sentries up and down the coast to watch for
        you should you try to move, and their sight grows with each day. You might
        win a few more battles, but your time here is over.”</p><p>Ingunn’s eyes narrowed
        and hissed as she said, “We are masters of the water. We have over a thousand
        fighters, more than enough to crush any force your mother might arrange. You
        lanweallers are too divided to amass more than a few hundred against us. We
        will do as we please.”</p><p>Shaking her head, Hani responded, “You do not
        know my mother. To some here, she has become known as the Seeress, a great
        prophetess. She need not sway kings and emperors directly, but the people
        instead. Once the people stand, their rulers will then stand. And stand in
        the thousands they will.</p><p>“If you try to move inland using the rivers,
        it will be as if the water has turned against you.”</p><p>“But you have another
        option, one you have not yet seen. Leave now with your gains. Return to your
        homeland in success. Some of your rivals, such as Jangerd, will see your success
        and try to repeat it. We will crush them as your coming here has angered many
        of us. And your power will grow.”</p><p>The thought of eliminating her rivals
        put a smile on Ingunn’s face. Especially since she would not have to confront
        them directly. “If what you say about your fighters is true, why tell me this?
        What do you hope to gain?”</p><p>Hani sighed heavily. “Life. Should a fight
        come now, many will die on both sides. This is what we, my mother and I, wish
        to avoid. Even though we have said we would crush your rivals when they attempt
        to repeat what you have done, it would be far fewer deaths for both sides.
        Fewer than if we fought you now.”</p><p>“Make no mistake, though. This is
        not weakness. There are those who see you as a plague and scourge and would
        willingly fight to the last to eliminate you. Some even have the means to
        do so if they realize it. Just as my mother is gathering forces to remove
        you, she holds them at bay. You should not trifle with her. You and I can
        see the hand of Fate before it moves, but my mother can control it if she
        chooses.” This last statement, Hani delivered with great confidence, as if
        she had seen it before.</p><p>The fingers on Ingunn’s free hand rubbed back
        and forth, as if feeling something. Given enough troops and time, the lanweallers
        could defeat her people. Now she was being given a chance to return home with
        success in hand, and an opportunity to eliminate possible future rivals now.</p><p>“And
        what about our slaves? Some of you lanweallers dislike your kind being made
        slaves.”</p><p>Hani hung her head as she spoke, “It pains me and mother to
        say this, but keep them. It will sate some of your kind’s thirst for pillaging
        this land.”</p><p>“I will think about terms and consult the runes, in private.
        I do not know if the other Pythonesses will follow me if I choose to leave,”
        Ingunn said, slightly nodding her head.</p><p>“If necessary, then let them
        choose their own fates,” was Hani’s calm reply. “I have now delivered the
        message and will leave you to contemplate it.” Hani then started walking down
        the game trail opposite the one Ingunn had come in on.</p><p>“You will know
        our decision by our actions,” Ingun said as Hani left.</p><p>***</p><p>It
        had been about an hour after Hani left Ingunn by the sputtering fire before
        she paused for a second to ensure she was not being followed. Not sensing
        anyone, she turned off the game trail and towards a more used path, and just
        before she reached this larger path, she stopped again. This time to throw
        up.</p><p>Hani took a few moments to recover from being sick, and she was
        still shaking from the encounter with Sutlander. The task her mother gave
        her took all her will to keep focused and master her emotions.</p><p>She followed
        the main trail until it exited the forest where there was a small camp of
        soldiers and aelves. A scout force in case the Sutlanders tried to make an
        unexpected move.</p><p>An aelf called out to her, “Hani, are you all right?”</p><p>“Aye,
        I am well. I just need to rest,” she explained.</p><p>“Then go and rest. But
        first, a rider brought a message from your mother for you. It is on your cot.”</p><p>Hani
        made her way to her tent and found the letter and read it:</p><p><i>My daughter,
        I know you were terrified and nervous at the task I sent you on. Often, much
        hangs in the balance and we must know when and the cost of putting our finger
        on the scale. But you have done well, and I am proud of you. At the very least,
        you have bought time for us to organize, and may have ended the threat of
        the Sutlanders yourself.</i></p><p><i>I know it pains you about leaving prisoners
        in the hands of the Sutlanders to become slaves. It pains me too. It is of
        little comfort, but it is better to sacrifice a few hundred to slavery than
        to commit thousands to death.</i></p><p><i>I cannot yet determine what course
        these Sutlander witches, as a whole, will take at this time. However, I have
        seen that several of them will leave Iliapin.</i></p><p><i>I want you to have
        one of the aelves take you to Willow’s Grove in the morning. I have made arrangements
        for the aelves there to guide you and your sisters to Aran. Wait for me there
        and I will join you as soon as I can.</i></p><p><i>Your mother,</i><i>Sarior</i></p><p>Hani’s
        eyes watered up as she fought back the tears, as she reread the letter to
        determine if she would see her mother again. Her ordeal with the Sutlander
        made her question if she could succeed her mother and she was weary after
        the meeting. Unable to focus her sight, she fell into a fitful sleep.</p></p>\",\"tree_html\":\"\"},\"trail\":[{\"blog\":{\"name\":\"p-s-smith-author\",\"active\":true,\"theme\":{\"header_full_width\":3000,\"header_full_height\":1055,\"avatar_shape\":\"circle\",\"background_color\":\"#FFFFFF\",\"body_font\":\"Helvetica

        late spring of 269, a large party of Sutlanders (who call themselves Busina)
        landed on Iliapin with approximately forty ships and estimated over a thousand
        raiders. They sacked several villages and the town of Whitbrook over the course
        of three weeks. In the town of Staghill, they killed some five thousand people,
        men, women and children, and there were no survivors reported.</i></p><p><i>A
        coalition of forces was being assembled to deal with this threat. It was not
        some ruler that organized this coalition, but by a foreign woman who began
        by railing commoners to stand and defend themselves….</i></p><p><i>… The Sutlanders
        left Iliapin before the troops could assemble, and for reasons unknown…</i></p><p><i>–Aakna,
        Sage of Elhrub</i></p><p><i>Year 372</i></p><p>Ingunn walked with a measured
        pace along the game trail through a forest of alien trees. Many of these trees
        supported leaves rather than needles, unlike the trees of her homeland. Some
        trees even bore the remains of flowers.</p><p>She had passed the last Busina
        sentry an hour ago. He had not tried to stop her or accompany her, for do
        so would be a sure way to incur the wrath of the Pythoness.</p><p>So far,
        her people’s raids had been fruitful. They had already sacked a small city
        and a few towns with little resistance. One town had tried to offer tribute
        to the Busina so not to attack, and it was Ingunn who ordered the town razed
        because they had tried to bribe them. Had a single warrior tried to stand
        against the Busina, they may have lived. The Busina put everyone to death
        because of their cowardice.</p><p>The Busina had accumulated slaves, iron,
        livestock, and food through their raids. They had harvested many large trees
        along the coast. They could breed more warriors, forge more weapons and build
        more ships, with these spoils. When they returned home, the warriors would
        receive a heroes’ welcome, and the Pythonesses were to be seen as demigods,
        with Ingunn chief among them.</p><p>Ingunn already held much sway over her
        clan and the other Pythonesses. Few would dare challenge her, especially if
        they wished to enter the next world, but there were those who would try. She
        needed more power to deal with them, as she had one of her apprentices.</p><p>Asta
        had tried to challenge her once, by seducing Svalfi. He was a capable leader
        and shrewd trader amongst the Busina, and would have made a fine chieftain
        and clan leader under Ingunn. Svalfi decided to side with Asta to form their
        own clan. It was Svalfi’s own wife who informed Ingunn of their plan. In retribution,
        Ingunn left them and twenty others stranded on an island. Ingunn also cut
        out Asta’s tongue before she blinded her so she could not use her sight, or
        tell others what she might read in the runes and bones. </p><p>That was five
        years ago. When Ingunn and the Busina passed the island this time, no one
        saw any sign of smoke, fire, or other signs of the exiles.</p><p>It had been
        several years since Ingunn and two of her chieftains, Athils and Gest, had
        made a raid to this land. They had been quite successful in previous years
        that they did not have to risk such a venture. Eventually, Athils sought to
        make himself a king and Gest sought to help him with that, as it would be
        Gest’s son, Athils’s son-in-law, who would inherit that crown. But early in
        the planning, Ingunn had a strange feeling about this raid.</p><p>Now, the
        Pythonesses debated on what to do, as some wanted to move inland for more
        targets, while others wanted to scour the coast. Ingunn wanted to explore
        inland and see if they could find a place for a colony. They had sufficient
        troops to start a settlement while the ships returned to bring back the families
        that had stayed behind. Yet, something gave Ingunn pause about proposing this.</p><p>She
        stopped for a moment and reached into the pouch tied to her belt and pulled
        three rune stones from it. Looking at the runes, she saw light, conflict and
        path. She screwed her face at the runes as she looked at them, trying to find
        their meaning. Ingunn put the runes back in the pouch and resumed walking.</p><p>Soon,
        the scent of smoke caught Ingunn’s nose. She pulled her knife and followed
        the smell, and tracked it to a young girl who might have been fourteen. The
        girl was calmly sitting by a small fire that had a small gourd over it. Her
        dress was brown and red and not much different from the ones worn by some
        of the newly gained slaves. To Ingunn, the girl’s relaxed demeanor showed
        she was waiting for someone.</p><p>Again, Ingunn pulled runes from her pouch.
        Light, conflict, path. Was it this girl? Was she a pythoness also? She replaced
        the runes and tried to envision what she should do, but there was a mist blocking
        her sight.</p><p>Ingunn had barely stepped towards the girl to either capture

        option, one you have not yet seen. Leave now with your gains. Return to your
        homeland in success. Some of your rivals, such as Jangerd, will see your success
        and try to repeat it. We will crush them as your coming here has angered many
        of us. And your power will grow.”</p><p>The thought of eliminating her rivals
        put a smile on Ingunn’s face. Especially since she would not have to confront
        them directly. “If what you say about your fighters is true, why tell me this?
        What do you hope to gain?”</p><p>Hani sighed heavily. “Life. Should a fight
        come now, many will die on both sides. This is what we, my mother and I, wish
        to avoid. Even though we have said we would crush your rivals when they attempt
        to repeat what you have done, it would be far fewer deaths for both sides.
        Fewer than if we fought you now.”</p><p>“Make no mistake, though. This is
        not weakness. There are those who see you as a plague and scourge and would
        willingly fight to the last to eliminate you. Some even have the means to
        do so if they realize it. Just as my mother is gathering forces to remove
        you, she holds them at bay. You should not trifle with her. You and I can
        see the hand of Fate before it moves, but my mother can control it if she
        chooses.” This last statement, Hani delivered with great confidence, as if
        she had seen it before.</p><p>The fingers on Ingunn’s free hand rubbed back
        and forth, as if feeling something. Given enough troops and time, the lanweallers
        could defeat her people. Now she was being given a chance to return home with
        success in hand, and an opportunity to eliminate possible future rivals now.</p><p>“And
        what about our slaves? Some of you lanweallers dislike your kind being made
        slaves.”</p><p>Hani hung her head as she spoke, “It pains me and mother to
        say this, but keep them. It will sate some of your kind’s thirst for pillaging
        this land.”</p><p>“I will think about terms and consult the runes, in private.
        I do not know if the other Pythonesses will follow me if I choose to leave,”
        Ingunn said, slightly nodding her head.</p><p>“If necessary, then let them
        choose their own fates,” was Hani’s calm reply. “I have now delivered the
        message and will leave you to contemplate it.” Hani then started walking down
        the game trail opposite the one Ingunn had come in on.</p><p>“You will know
        our decision by our actions,” Ingun said as Hani left.</p><p>***</p><p>It
        had been about an hour after Hani left Ingunn by the sputtering fire before
        she paused for a second to ensure she was not being followed. Not sensing
        anyone, she turned off the game trail and towards a more used path, and just
        before she reached this larger path, she stopped again. This time to throw
        up.</p><p>Hani took a few moments to recover from being sick, and she was
        still shaking from the encounter with Sutlander. The task her mother gave
        her took all her will to keep focused and master her emotions.</p><p>She followed
        the main trail until it exited the forest where there was a small camp of
        soldiers and aelves. A scout force in case the Sutlanders tried to make an
        unexpected move.</p><p>An aelf called out to her, “Hani, are you all right?”</p><p>“Aye,
        I am well. I just need to rest,” she explained.</p><p>“Then go and rest. But
        first, a rider brought a message from your mother for you. It is on your cot.”</p><p>Hani
        made her way to her tent and found the letter and read it:</p><p><i>My daughter,
        I know you were terrified and nervous at the task I sent you on. Often, much
        hangs in the balance and we must know when and the cost of putting our finger
        on the scale. But you have done well, and I am proud of you. At the very least,
        you have bought time for us to organize, and may have ended the threat of
        the Sutlanders yourself.</i></p><p><i>I know it pains you about leaving prisoners
        in the hands of the Sutlanders to become slaves. It pains me too. It is of
        little comfort, but it is better to sacrifice a few hundred to slavery than
        to commit thousands to death.</i></p><p><i>I cannot yet determine what course
        these Sutlander witches, as a whole, will take at this time. However, I have

        and I will join you as soon as I can.</i></p><p><i>Your mother,</i><i>Sarior</i></p><p>Hani’s
        eyes watered up as she fought back the tears, as she reread the letter to
        determine if she would see her mother again. Her ordeal with the Sutlander
        made her question if she could succeed her mother and she was weary after
        the meeting. Unable to focus her sight, she fell into a fitful sleep.</p></p>\",\"content\":\"<p><h1>The

        late spring of 269, a large party of Sutlanders (who call themselves Busina)
        landed on Iliapin with approximately forty ships and estimated over a thousand
        raiders. They sacked several villages and the town of Whitbrook over the course
        of three weeks. In the town of Staghill, they killed some five thousand people,
        men, women and children, and there were no survivors reported.</i></p><p><i>A
        coalition of forces was being assembled to deal with this threat. It was not
        some ruler that organized this coalition, but by a foreign woman who began
        by railing commoners to stand and defend themselves&hellip;.</i></p><p><i>&hellip;
        The Sutlanders left Iliapin before the troops could assemble, and for reasons
        unknown&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ndash;Aakna, Sage of Elhrub</i></p><p><i>Year
        372</i></p><p>Ingunn walked with a measured pace along the game trail through
        a forest of alien trees. Many of these trees supported leaves rather than
        needles, unlike the trees of her homeland. Some trees even bore the remains
        of flowers.</p><p>She had passed the last Busina sentry an hour ago. He had
        not tried to stop her or accompany her, for do so would be a sure way to incur
        the wrath of the Pythoness.</p><p>So far, her people&rsquo;s raids had been
        fruitful. They had already sacked a small city and a few towns with little
        resistance. One town had tried to offer tribute to the Busina so not to attack,
        and it was Ingunn who ordered the town razed because they had tried to bribe
        them. Had a single warrior tried to stand against the Busina, they may have
        lived. The Busina put everyone to death because of their cowardice.</p><p>The
        Busina had accumulated slaves, iron, livestock, and food through their raids.
        They had harvested many large trees along the coast. They could breed more
        warriors, forge more weapons and build more ships, with these spoils. When
        they returned home, the warriors would receive a heroes&rsquo; welcome, and
        the Pythonesses were to be seen as demigods, with Ingunn chief among them.</p><p>Ingunn
        already held much sway over her clan and the other Pythonesses. Few would
        dare challenge her, especially if they wished to enter the next world, but
        there were those who would try. She needed more power to deal with them, as
        she had one of her apprentices.</p><p>Asta had tried to challenge her once,
        by seducing Svalfi. He was a capable leader and shrewd trader amongst the
        Busina, and would have made a fine chieftain and clan leader under Ingunn.
        Svalfi decided to side with Asta to form their own clan. It was Svalfi&rsquo;s
        own wife who informed Ingunn of their plan. In retribution, Ingunn left them
        and twenty others stranded on an island. Ingunn also cut out Asta&rsquo;s
        tongue before she blinded her so she could not use her sight, or tell others
        what she might read in the runes and bones.&nbsp;</p><p>That was five years
        ago. When Ingunn and the Busina passed the island this time, no one saw any
        sign of smoke, fire, or other signs of the exiles.</p><p>It had been several
        years since Ingunn and two of her chieftains, Athils and Gest, had made a
        raid to this land. They had been quite successful in previous years that they
        did not have to risk such a venture. Eventually, Athils sought to make himself
        a king and Gest sought to help him with that, as it would be Gest&rsquo;s
        son, Athils&rsquo;s son-in-law, who would inherit that crown. But early in
        the planning, Ingunn had a strange feeling about this raid.</p><p>Now, the
        Pythonesses debated on what to do, as some wanted to move inland for more
        targets, while others wanted to scour the coast. Ingunn wanted to explore
        inland and see if they could find a place for a colony. They had sufficient
        troops to start a settlement while the ships returned to bring back the families
        that had stayed behind. Yet, something gave Ingunn pause about proposing this.</p><p>She
        stopped for a moment and reached into the pouch tied to her belt and pulled
        three rune stones from it. Looking at the runes, she saw light, conflict and
        path. She screwed her face at the runes as she looked at them, trying to find
        their meaning. Ingunn put the runes back in the pouch and resumed walking.</p><p>Soon,
        the scent of smoke caught Ingunn&rsquo;s nose. She pulled her knife and followed
        the smell, and tracked it to a young girl who might have been fourteen. The
        girl was calmly sitting by a small fire that had a small gourd over it. Her
        dress was brown and red and not much different from the ones worn by some
        of the newly gained slaves. To Ingunn, the girl&rsquo;s relaxed demeanor showed
        she was waiting for someone.</p><p>Again, Ingunn pulled runes from her pouch.
        Light, conflict, path. Was it this girl? Was she a pythoness also? She replaced
        the runes and tried to envision what she should do, but there was a mist blocking
        her sight.</p><p>Ingunn had barely stepped towards the girl to either capture
        her, or, failing that, kill her, when the girl stood up. &ldquo;I have been
        expecting you,&rdquo; the girl said, facing Ingunn. &ldquo;I am to parley
        with you.&rdquo; She spoke in the language used by Businan slaves.</p><p>Ingunn
        smiled to herself. Someone has sent this poor girl to meet her fate. Soon
        she would either be a slave, a toy, or dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Please come closer.
        I have tea, if you drink such things,&rdquo; the girl said, with some nervousness
        in her voice.</p><p>Ingunn approached at this, wary of any traps or ambushes.</p><p>&ldquo;No
        need for all that caution. Had I wished harm to you, I have friends who could
        have already done that. And please, there is no need for your knife.&rdquo;</p><p>Ingunn
        paused for a second, sensing the girl. Yes, it was the girl. She was a pythoness
        and seemingly powerful one in her own right. She would be a wonderful prize
        for Gest&rsquo;s son. But she was wary, so Ingunn would have to bide her time
        some.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know I was coming? Who sent you?&rdquo; Ingunn
        asked with authority.</p><p>The girl seemed a little unnerved by Ingunn&rsquo;s
        questions. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the girl started before she took a deep breath,
        sat back down, and continued. &ldquo;I am Hani. My mother, Sarior, sent me
        to meet with you. And like you, we possess the gift of sight.&rdquo;</p><p>Ingunn&rsquo;s
        eyes narrowed as she examined Hani. She could sense the girl was uneasy, but
        she did not seem scared. She possessed a determination to do what her mother
        had sent her to do. Ingunn walked towards the fire where Hani sat.</p><p>&ldquo;You
        and your mother might possess the sight, but you are weak and do not know
        how to use it. You lanweallers will succumb to us Busina, and I will take
        you and your mother and either make you trophies, or destroy you.&rdquo;</p><p>Hani
        did not flinch at this threat, as she poured a colored liquid into a pair
        of cups. With Hani&rsquo;s eyes diverted, Ingunn saw this as an opportunity
        to take her quarry and lunged at Hani.</p><p>Before Ingunn&rsquo;s attack
        could land, Hani rolled and spun away. Ingunn immediately recovered, wide
        eyed to find Hani was now standing several feet away, holding her own knife,
        braced for another attack.</p><p>Hani looked down at the ground where she
        had been sitting and said, with a note of disappointment, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
        made me spill our tea.&rdquo; She then locked her gaze on Ingunn. &ldquo;You
        cannot win, for I can see your moves before you act and the aelves have taught
        me to fight,&rdquo; Hani said with a confidence Ingunn had not expected. &ldquo;Should
        you attempt to harm me again, Fate will destroy your expedition, thus ruin
        you. &ldquo;</p><p>When Ingunn hesitated about what to do next, Hani said,
        &ldquo;Twice while coming here, you pulled runes. Twice you pulled the same
        runes. Light, conflict and path. You have not yet fully deciphered their meaning.
        But I know their meaning,&rdquo; Hani said, with emphasis on her last statement.</p><p>&ldquo;The
        &lsquo;light&rsquo; is knowledge and information. This I have for you. The
        &lsquo;conflict&rsquo; is what to do with the information I am to give you
        and the choices you make with it. The &lsquo;path&rsquo; is the course of
        action you take with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it, girl. Give me your
        words,&rdquo; Ingunn said with a sneer as she lowered her knife. She had underestimated
        Hani once. Now she would listen to her chatter to lull her into a false security
        before she would try again.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother knows that you are currently
        debating what to do. Some of you wish to push inland, others want to go elsewhere
        along the coast before returning to your home. You alone contemplate moving
        inland to establish a settlement or colony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But know this,
        my mother and my sisters are building a coalition against you Sutlanders.
        Several nations have already pledged to help and are sending men to fight
        you. Aelves are already in position to harass you and in seven days, there
        will be enough troops to attack you. There are sentries up and down the coast
        to watch for you should you try to move, and their sight grows with each day.
        You might win a few more battles, but your time here is over.&rdquo;</p><p>Ingunn&rsquo;s
        eyes narrowed and hissed as she said, &ldquo;We are masters of the water.
        We have over a thousand fighters, more than enough to crush any force your
        mother might arrange. You lanweallers are too divided to amass more than a
        few hundred against us. We will do as we please.&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking her
        head, Hani responded, &ldquo;You do not know my mother. To some here, she
        has become known as the Seeress, a great prophetess. She need not sway kings
        and emperors directly, but the people instead. Once the people stand, their
        rulers will then stand. And stand in the thousands they will.</p><p>&ldquo;If
        you try to move inland using the rivers, it will be as if the water has turned
        against you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have another option, one you have
        not yet seen. Leave now with your gains. Return to your homeland in success.
        Some of your rivals, such as Jangerd, will see your success and try to repeat
        it. We will crush them as your coming here has angered many of us. And your
        power will grow.&rdquo;</p><p>The thought of eliminating her rivals put a
        smile on Ingunn&rsquo;s face. Especially since she would not have to confront
        them directly. &ldquo;If what you say about your fighters is true, why tell
        me this? What do you hope to gain?&rdquo;</p><p>Hani sighed heavily. &ldquo;Life.
        Should a fight come now, many will die on both sides. This is what we, my
        mother and I, wish to avoid. Even though we have said we would crush your
        rivals when they attempt to repeat what you have done, it would be far fewer
        deaths for both sides. Fewer than if we fought you now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make
        no mistake, though. This is not weakness. There are those who see you as a
        plague and scourge and would willingly fight to the last to eliminate you.
        Some even have the means to do so if they realize it. Just as my mother is
        gathering forces to remove you, she holds them at bay. You should not trifle
        with her. You and I can see the hand of Fate before it moves, but my mother
        can control it if she chooses.&rdquo; This last statement, Hani delivered
        with great confidence, as if she had seen it before.</p><p>The fingers on
        Ingunn&rsquo;s free hand rubbed back and forth, as if feeling something. Given
        enough troops and time, the lanweallers could defeat her people. Now she was
        being given a chance to return home with success in hand, and an opportunity
        to eliminate possible future rivals now.</p><p>&ldquo;And what about our slaves?
        Some of you lanweallers dislike your kind being made slaves.&rdquo;</p><p>Hani
        hung her head as she spoke, &ldquo;It pains me and mother to say this, but
        keep them. It will sate some of your kind&rsquo;s thirst for pillaging this
        land.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will think about terms and consult the runes,
        in private. I do not know if the other Pythonesses will follow me if I choose
        to leave,&rdquo; Ingunn said, slightly nodding her head.</p><p>&ldquo;If necessary,
        then let them choose their own fates,&rdquo; was Hani&rsquo;s calm reply.
        &ldquo;I have now delivered the message and will leave you to contemplate
        it.&rdquo; Hani then started walking down the game trail opposite the one
        Ingunn had come in on.</p><p>&ldquo;You will know our decision by our actions,&rdquo;
        Ingun said as Hani left.</p><p>***</p><p>It had been about an hour after Hani
        left Ingunn by the sputtering fire before she paused for a second to ensure
        she was not being followed. Not sensing anyone, she turned off the game trail
        and towards a more used path, and just before she reached this larger path,
        she stopped again. This time to throw up.</p><p>Hani took a few moments to
        recover from being sick, and she was still shaking from the encounter with
        Sutlander. The task her mother gave her took all her will to keep focused

        multiverse of 49 magics, focused mainly on a series of queer fantasy novellas,
        written by @isabellebissonrouthier! They are aimed at adults, but there is
        no explicit content in the main series. The books of that main series follow
        their own main characters, navigating unique magics, gifted by gods, as they
        traverse their world of Ungode. And there's more on the way... like an urban
        fantasy exploration of this magic system, a contemporary (explicit) romance
        with some of the characters, a superhero series, and so much more! \\n49:

        A love story, by Taylor Jenkins Reid.</h1><p>I&rsquo;m going to start by saying—because
        I WANT to review this book, absolutely—that the title doesn&rsquo;t lie: ATMOSPHERE,
        by Taylor Jenkins Reid, IS A LOVE STORY. Love, in CAPITAL LETTERS. Love, in
        general. To space. To the stars. To our sun. To Earth. To learning; to knowledge,
        for its own sake. To the people around you (whether they&rsquo;re family or
        not). To others for who they are. The old-fashioned way. To humanity.</p><p>Love
        is everywhere, and perhaps that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a beautiful story.</p><p>Told
        in simple language that anyone could understand—especially if they have even
        the slightest interest in the history of NASA, in humanity&rsquo;s achievements
        in reaching the afterlife beyond Earth, or in the afterlife itself—ATMOSPHERE
        tells the story of Joan Goodwin. A character as central as a spectator who,
        after being admitted to train at the agency during the 1980s, begins to discover
        herself and WHO SHE REALLY WANTS TO BE. Therefore, we will not only have tests
        for astronauts and the universe as companions, but also Joan&rsquo;s personal
        relationships in a balance that, to me, at least, SEEMED PERFECT.</p><p>Although,
        in general terms, we could actually say that it&rsquo;s just an okay story;
        which, depending on the reader, may not be as convincing (since this seems
        to be Taylor Jenkins Reid&rsquo;s gift, so to speak. I haven&rsquo;t liked
        or been as interested in the rest of her stories as this one, and I see that
        it has happened to more people; each one has their own special book about
        her… Which, in part, I find very admirable). But I, personally, gave it a
        4/5. And not just because I love space, although that gives the book extra
        points! But also because I love the calm, gentle way she transports us to
        everything: the good and the bad, even the worst arguments. The damn beautiful
        relationship between Joan and her niece, Frances, and the whole horrible situation
        with her sister Barbara (which is more realistic than other people can accept,
        it seems); how I identified with Vanessa… How I understood both of their feelings.
        First, with wanting to leave this planet, and then, also, being moved by why
        they should return. And the debates! How everyone has their own vision and
        yet we can coexist (that&rsquo;s something many are still learning, haha).</p><p>It&rsquo;s
        true that the book has its things, but I feel they&rsquo;re subjective; Some
        of them are very typical of the time and country where it&rsquo;s set (despite
        being, in part, an alternative history) or were derived from the characters&rsquo;
        characteristics, and there&rsquo;s not much that can be done about that (although
        I admit I never understood the hatred toward Lydia. I think she was a very
        honest and brilliant person (yes, in my opinion, she deserved more than what
        she got. And sometimes I even liked her a thousand times more than Joan, hahaha),
        because it almost always shows how unjustified that hatred is, which is, rather,
        filthy envy, haha).</p><p>So, in conclusion, if you&rsquo;re looking for a
        simple but beautiful story, or one that starts to get you interested in the
        whole space theme, ATMOSPHERE is a good bet. And I recommend it.</p><div class=\\\"npf_row\\\"><figure

        A love story, by Taylor Jenkins Reid.</h1><p>I’m going to start by saying—because
        I WANT to review this book, absolutely—that the title doesn’t lie: ATMOSPHERE,
        by Taylor Jenkins Reid, IS A LOVE STORY. Love, in CAPITAL LETTERS. Love, in
        general. To space. To the stars. To our sun. To Earth. To learning; to knowledge,
        for its own sake. To the people around you (whether they’re family or not).
        To others for who they are. The old-fashioned way. To humanity.</p><p>Love
        is everywhere, and perhaps that’s why it’s such a beautiful story.</p><p>Told
        in simple language that anyone could understand—especially if they have even
        the slightest interest in the history of NASA, in humanity’s achievements
        in reaching the afterlife beyond Earth, or in the afterlife itself—ATMOSPHERE
        tells the story of Joan Goodwin. A character as central as a spectator who,
        after being admitted to train at the agency during the 1980s, begins to discover
        herself and WHO SHE REALLY WANTS TO BE. Therefore, we will not only have tests
        for astronauts and the universe as companions, but also Joan’s personal relationships
        in a balance that, to me, at least, SEEMED PERFECT.</p><p>Although, in general
        terms, we could actually say that it’s just an okay story; which, depending
        on the reader, may not be as convincing (since this seems to be Taylor Jenkins
        Reid’s gift, so to speak. I haven’t liked or been as interested in the rest
        of her stories as this one, and I see that it has happened to more people;
        each one has their own special book about her… Which, in part, I find very
        admirable). But I, personally, gave it a 4/5. And not just because I love
        space, although that gives the book extra points! But also because I love
        the calm, gentle way she transports us to everything: the good and the bad,
        even the worst arguments. The damn beautiful relationship between Joan and
        her niece, Frances, and the whole horrible situation with her sister Barbara
        (which is more realistic than other people can accept, it seems); how I identified
        with Vanessa… How I understood both of their feelings. First, with wanting
        to leave this planet, and then, also, being moved by why they should return.
        And the debates! How everyone has their own vision and yet we can coexist
        (that’s something many are still learning, haha).</p><p>It’s true that the
        book has its things, but I feel they’re subjective; Some of them are very
        typical of the time and country where it’s set (despite being, in part, an
        alternative history) or were derived from the characters’ characteristics,
        and there’s not much that can be done about that (although I admit I never
        understood the hatred toward Lydia. I think she was a very honest and brilliant
        person (yes, in my opinion, she deserved more than what she got. And sometimes
        I even liked her a thousand times more than Joan, hahaha), because it almost
        always shows how unjustified that hatred is, which is, rather, filthy envy,
        haha).</p><p>So, in conclusion, if you’re looking for a simple but beautiful
        story, or one that starts to get you interested in the whole space theme,
        ATMOSPHERE is a good bet. And I recommend it.</p><div class=\\\"npf_row\\\"><figure

        In addition I wanted to thank everyone who&rsquo;ve been liking and commenting

        spread to the hospital<b>.</b>The two women were in the air, clashing again
        and again. Both had sustained wounds, though Saphire was bleeding more. The
        battle against Dara had left its mark on her and drained her energy more than
        she had expected. And now, that cost was being paid.</p><p>Seraphina threw
        her spear at Saphire, who managed to defend herself by slashing the spear
        away. However, when the spear was gone, Seraphina too was nowhere to be seen.
        Only when Saphire heard the beating of wings did she raise her head—just in
        time for Seraphina to smash her burning fist into her face. Saphire crashed
        into the ground. But Seraphina wasn’t done. The battle had shifted in her
        favor, and she would use that opportunity.</p><p>Immediately, she opened her
        mouth and unleashed a sea of flames at Saphire, who was still struggling to
        stand. The flames struck her mercilessly.</p><p>Still, she wouldn’t be a Celestial
        if that was all it took to defeat her. She rose from the flames—wounded, yet
        her majestic demeanor remained. And she bellowed:<br/>“So that is the power
        of a Dragon Monarch! Excellent! You’re the first dragon to push me this far!
        Let me display my true power!”</p><p>The winds started gathering in one place,
        and at its center, wicked demon energy also condensed. So much air was drawn
        in that Seraphina struggled to breathe. At the same time, she fought the pull
        of the wind.<br/><i>(Seraphina: Damn! If we continue, this place—no, the whole
        city—will be blown away!)</i></p><p><b>In the hospital</b><br/>Dean had no
        time to question what was happening. He had one job—only one: protect Larah
        and defeat the light priest. And he would accomplish it, no matter the cost.</p><p>Once
        again, he felt that burning sensation, stronger this time. He pounced on the
        roots closing in, not understanding anything but thrusting his fist forward.
        And it worked—his fist destroyed the roots, one after another.</p><p>“The
        fuck!” the light priest bellowed. “No, that can’t be! I must finish him as
        fast as possible!”</p><p>The priest formed a sword from his ability and launched
        at Dean, hiding behind more roots. Punch after punch, Dean destroyed them.
        The last root transformed into a snake and slithered toward him.</p><p>Dean
        was sweating heavily. His heart pounded, his palms ached, his legs screamed
        for rest, and his eyes craved a break. But his will had other plans. It fueled
        his body with the strength needed to face the enemy once more.</p><p>Dean
        formed a mighty fist, glowing with white and golden light. Without understanding
        what was happening to his hand, he punched the snake—and obliterated it completely.</p><p>From
        behind the explosion, the priest emerged. With a thrust of his sword, he pierced
        Dean’s chest.</p><p>Immediately, a blinding light exploded from Dean, towering
        into the heavens and destroying everything in its path.</p><p>Larah stood
        frozen. She didn’t know what to say or do anymore—and had no strength left
        to try. So she remained silent, marveling at the beauty of the light.</p><p><b>On
        the battlefield</b><br/>Commander Nootra transformed back into his human form.
        At once, all energy left his body. Fortunately, Nicole was at his side to
        keep him standing.</p><p>“Boss, didn’t know you had that power in you!”</p><p>“I
        never told anyone. The first time I used it&hellip; I killed many people.
        People dear to me. That’s why…”</p><p>“I understand. I understand.”</p><p>Just
        as she finished speaking, soldiers from Special Force Alpha arrived on the
        battlefield and helped Jessie and the others exterminate the remaining ghouls.</p><p>Commander
        Nootra coughed and took a step back, giving Nicole some space.<br/>“Explain
        the situation! Why are you here? What is happening in the forest?”</p><p>A
        soldier saluted and reported:<br/>“A demon appeared. She’s on Celestial level.
        Dara stayed behind to get you.”</p><p>“That can’t be Dara fighting,” the commander
        muttered. “This is a battle between two beings on a Celestial level—that’s
        for sure! We should—”</p><p>A pillar of light—Dean’s light—shot out from the
        hospital, piercing the heavens.</p><p><b>In the forest</b><br/>Just as Saphire
        and Seraphina were about to clash again, they noticed the column of light.
        Seraphina was the first to stop. She fixed her gaze on it.</p><p>“Someone
        you know?” Saphire asked.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then let’s stop the fight.
        Seems like your presence is needed elsewhere. And I must admit, fighting you
        in my current state&hellip; I hate to say it, but I stand no chance right
        now.”</p><p>“Well, we did agree on a fair fight. It wouldn’t be fair to fight
        you while you&rsquo;re weakened. Okay then, go. But if I sense your energy
        in this area again, I’ll hunt you.”</p><p>“You won’t. I give you my word.”</p><p>And
        so, Seraphina hurried toward the light, while Saphire left the battlefield.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a

        cracks of the fierce battle slowly spread to the hospital<b>.</b>The two women
        were in the air, clashing again and again. Both had sustained wounds, though
        Saphire was bleeding more. The battle against Dara had left its mark on her
        and drained her energy more than she had expected. And now, that cost was
        being paid.</p><p>Seraphina threw her spear at Saphire, who managed to defend
        herself by slashing the spear away. However, when the spear was gone, Seraphina
        too was nowhere to be seen. Only when Saphire heard the beating of wings did
        she raise her head—just in time for Seraphina to smash her burning fist into
        her face. Saphire crashed into the ground. But Seraphina wasn’t done. The
        battle had shifted in her favor, and she would use that opportunity.</p><p>Immediately,
        she opened her mouth and unleashed a sea of flames at Saphire, who was still
        struggling to stand. The flames struck her mercilessly.</p><p>Still, she wouldn’t
        be a Celestial if that was all it took to defeat her. She rose from the flames—wounded,
        yet her majestic demeanor remained. And she bellowed:<br>“So that is the power
        of a Dragon Monarch! Excellent! You’re the first dragon to push me this far!
        Let me display my true power!”</p><p>The winds started gathering in one place,
        and at its center, wicked demon energy also condensed. So much air was drawn
        in that Seraphina struggled to breathe. At the same time, she fought the pull
        of the wind.<br><i>(Seraphina: Damn! If we continue, this place—no, the whole
        city—will be blown away!)</i></p><p><b>In the hospital</b><br>Dean had no
        time to question what was happening. He had one job—only one: protect Larah
        and defeat the light priest. And he would accomplish it, no matter the cost.</p><p>Once
        again, he felt that burning sensation, stronger this time. He pounced on the
        roots closing in, not understanding anything but thrusting his fist forward.
        And it worked—his fist destroyed the roots, one after another.</p><p>“The
        fuck!” the light priest bellowed. “No, that can’t be! I must finish him as
        fast as possible!”</p><p>The priest formed a sword from his ability and launched
        at Dean, hiding behind more roots. Punch after punch, Dean destroyed them.
        The last root transformed into a snake and slithered toward him.</p><p>Dean
        was sweating heavily. His heart pounded, his palms ached, his legs screamed
        for rest, and his eyes craved a break. But his will had other plans. It fueled
        his body with the strength needed to face the enemy once more.</p><p>Dean
        formed a mighty fist, glowing with white and golden light. Without understanding
        what was happening to his hand, he punched the snake—and obliterated it completely.</p><p>From
        behind the explosion, the priest emerged. With a thrust of his sword, he pierced
        Dean’s chest.</p><p>Immediately, a blinding light exploded from Dean, towering
        into the heavens and destroying everything in its path.</p><p>Larah stood
        frozen. She didn’t know what to say or do anymore—and had no strength left
        to try. So she remained silent, marveling at the beauty of the light.</p><p><b>On
        the battlefield</b><br>Commander Nootra transformed back into his human form.
        At once, all energy left his body. Fortunately, Nicole was at his side to
        keep him standing.</p><p>“Boss, didn’t know you had that power in you!”</p><p>“I
        never told anyone. The first time I used it… I killed many people. People
        dear to me. That’s why…”</p><p>“I understand. I understand.”</p><p>Just as
        she finished speaking, soldiers from Special Force Alpha arrived on the battlefield
        and helped Jessie and the others exterminate the remaining ghouls.</p><p>Commander
        Nootra coughed and took a step back, giving Nicole some space.<br>“Explain
        the situation! Why are you here? What is happening in the forest?”</p><p>A
        soldier saluted and reported:<br>“A demon appeared. She’s on Celestial level.
        Dara stayed behind to get you.”</p><p>“That can’t be Dara fighting,” the commander
        muttered. “This is a battle between two beings on a Celestial level—that’s
        for sure! We should—”</p><p>A pillar of light—Dean’s light—shot out from the
        hospital, piercing the heavens.</p><p><b>In the forest</b><br>Just as Saphire
        and Seraphina were about to clash again, they noticed the column of light.
        Seraphina was the first to stop. She fixed her gaze on it.</p><p>“Someone
        you know?” Saphire asked.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then let’s stop the fight.
        Seems like your presence is needed elsewhere. And I must admit, fighting you
        in my current state… I hate to say it, but I stand no chance right now.”</p><p>“Well,
        we did agree on a fair fight. It wouldn’t be fair to fight you while you’re
        weakened. Okay then, go. But if I sense your energy in this area again, I’ll
        hunt you.”</p><p>“You won’t. I give you my word.”</p><p>And so, Seraphina
        hurried toward the light, while Saphire left the battlefield.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a
